  <p class="section-title"><span>goals of the training</span></p>
  After successfully completing the Mined Minds training course, attendees will have the skills that they require to start a career in the ever-expanding and highly paid software industry. As well as technical skills, we will help develop professional skills, and provide advice and contacts for securing a first job in the industry.<br /><br />
    Our goal is to teach programming fundementals and an adaptable approach to learning, so that students can continue to learn and succeed in the ever changing programming ecosystem. Primarily, we use the Ruby programming language for the course, because it is flexible for working in multiple programming styles and teaching varied concepts, whilst being easy to learn and widely used in industry. We also cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The concepts and skills that the students learn will allow them to have the flexibility of working in multiple languages and frameworks, and so be able to meet the varied demands of software development work.<br /><br />
    A successful career in programming requires a continual learning approach. This course gives the foundations upon which a new career can be built. Many of the graduates from our course have found paid employment directly with us, and we will help all graduates that are passionate about working in the technology industry to start their new career.<br /><br />
  <p class="section-title"><span>entry requirements</span></p>
    There are no formal educational requirements to join a course. The training is provided to qualifying participants for free, and at a low cost for others. Indeed, we believe that the industry benefits from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we have seen how this is also of benefit for the overall learning within our training program, since students learn different approaches and ways of thinking from each other.<br /><br />
    What is required is a logical mind, a passion for learning, and lots of curiosity and determination. The course is not designed to be easy - it is designed to prepare you to start a new career.<br /><br />
    If you are interested in joining a class, then be prepared to convince us that you have the passion and drive to succeed.
