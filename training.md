  <p class="section-title"><span>goals of the training</span></p>
  <p>After successfully completing the Mined Minds training course, attendees will have the skills that they require to start a career in the ever-expanding and highly paid software industry. As well as technical skills, we will help develop professional skills, and provide advice and contacts for securing a first job in the industry.<br><br>
    Our goal is to teach programming fundementals and an adaptable approach to learning, so that students can continue to learn and succeed in the ever changing programming ecosystem. We use the Ruby programming language for the course, because it is flexible for working in multiple programming styles and teaching varied concepts, whilst being easy to learn and widely used in industry. The concepts and skills that the students learn will allow them to have the flexibility of working in multiple languages and frameworks, and so be able to meet the varied demands of software development work.<br><br>
    A successful career in programming requires a continual learning approach. This course gives the foundations upon which a new career can be built.<br><br></p>
  <p class="section-title"><span>entry requirements</span></p>
    <p>There are no formal educational requirements to join a course, and the training is provided for free. Indeed, we believe that the industry benefits from a diverse range of backgrounds, and we have seen how this is also of benefit for the overall learning within our training program, since students learn different approaches and ways of thinking from each other.<br><br>
    What is required is a logical mind, a passion for learning, and lots of curiosity and determination. You will also need to be able to commit the required time to complete the training - the current class spend on average 25 - 30 hours each week, on a combination of on-site classes, remote classes, and homework assignments. The course is not designed to be easy - it is designed to prepare you to start a new career.<br><br>
    If you are interested in joining the next class, then be prepared to convince us that you have the passion and drive to succeed.
