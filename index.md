  <p class="section-title"><span>VISION</span></p>
  <p><a href="team.html">Mined Minds</a> are looking to kick-start the tech industry in Greene County and you could be part of it! 
</p>
  <article class="research-item">
    <h2>What We Can Offer</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a training course that gives attendees enough skills so that they will be employable as entry level computer programmers in the ever-expanding and highly paid software industry. This doesn't mean talent leaving Greene County, as we'll help dedicated attendees to find jobs locally or that allow them to work from home. 
    <br><br>
    The courses will be 100% free to the participants. We are in the process of trying to get grants and donations to fund the purchase of laptops for those who don't already have. We also have many world-leading experts in computer programming that have already committed to providing additional support and training, so the network opportunity for attendees is huge.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Attend</h2>
    <p>We are looking for people with a logical mind and a commitment to learn. That's it. Simple!<br><br>
    There are no formal education requirements, and study time is flexible, other than the local weekend training sessions.<br><br>
    The only other requirement is access to the internet so that attendees can complete training exercises between classes and attend online learning sessions.</p>
