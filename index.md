  <p class="section-title"><span>VISION</span></p>
  <p><a href="team.html">Mined Minds</a> are looking to kick-start the tech industry in Greene County and you could be part of it! 
</p>
  <article class="research-item">
    <h2>What We Can Offer</h2>
    <p>Our goal is to provide a training course to give attendees enough skills so that they will be employable as entry level computer programmers in the ever-expanding and highly paid software industry. This doesn't mean talent leaving Greene County, as we'll help dedicated attendees to find jobs locally or working from home, and so bringing money into the community. There is also the potential for us to create jobs directly through this venture, and a thriving local tech scene is what we hope to create.<br><br>
    The courses will be 100% free to the participants. We are in the process of trying to get grants and donations to fund the purchase of laptops for those who don't have already. Any machine will do, even a Raspberry Pi 2, which only costs $70! We also have many world-leading experts in computer programming that have already committed to providing additional support and training, so the network opportunity for attendees is huge.</p>

    <h2>Who Can Attend</h2>
    <p>We are looking for people with a logical mind and a commitment to learn. That's it. Simple!<br><br>
    There are no formal education requirements, and your study time is flexible, as long as you can attend the local weekend training sessions.<br><br>
    The only other than that you require is access to the internet so that you can complete training exercises between classes and attend online learning sessions.</p>
