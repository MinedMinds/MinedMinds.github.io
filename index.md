  <p class="section-title"><span>VISION</span></p>
    Mined Minds believes anyone can have a sucessful career in programming, and that a community working together towards common goals can change the economic driving force behind the local economy.<br><br>
    We intend to seed the growth of a technology hub within Greene County, Pennsylvania, and for the information revolution to be the fuel to drive the area into the future. Mined Minds provides free computer programming training for local residents that would like to start a career within software development, and we offer software consultancy services to local businesses and government.
    <br><br> 
  <p class="section-title"><span>TRAINING</span></p>
    We provide a free training course that, upon successful completion, will give attendees the skills that they require to start a career in the ever-expanding and highly paid software industry. As well as technical skills, we will help develop the students professional skills, and provide advice and contacts for securing a first job in the industry. There may also be opportunities for graduates from the course to take a position working directly with us in Greene County, PA. 
    <br><br>
    The courses are part-time, and last for approximately six months in duration. There are on-site classes every other weekend, and remote classes on weekday evenings. Additionally, there are individual and group assignments, with the total time commitment required for a student on the course averaging about 25-30 hours each week.
    <br><br>
    We are looking for people with a logical mind and a commitment to learn. There are no formal education requirements, and we value people with varied backgrounds. The next course will start in January 2016, and there will be informational sessions over the weekend of December 19th / 20th - more details to come.<br><br>
