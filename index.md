  <p class="section-title"><span>ABOUT</span></p>
    Mined Minds believes anyone can have a successful career in software development, and that a community working together towards common goals can change the economic driving force behind the local economy. We intend to seed the growth of technology hubs within the coal towns located in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The information revolution can be the fuel to drive these areas into the future.

    <b><a href="training.html">Mined Minds Foundation</a></b> is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, building a supply of talented technology professionals by providing computer programming training to local residents that would like to start a career within software development. We offer the training at no cost to qualifying individuals, and currently run classes in Waynesburg PA and Charleston WV.
